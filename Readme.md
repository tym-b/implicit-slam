## Dense SLAM with an Implicit Neural Representation
This project has been implemented during my MSc course in Computer Graphics, Vision and Imaging at UCL. It is basically an implementation of [iMap](https://edgarsucar.github.io/iMAP/), with some slight modifications. [TUM](https://vision.in.tum.de/data/datasets/rgbd-dataset) and [ICL-NUIM](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~ahanda/VaFRIC/iclnuim.html) sequences have been used for benchmarking and evaluation of reconstruction quality. The project can be easily run on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1BKGNl2iTkEsfRbMgC0QSG_QiQ6gZGc7-?usp=sharing).
