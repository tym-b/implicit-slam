## Dense SLAM with an Implicit Neural Representation
<div align="center"><img src="./icl_reconstruction.gif" alt="Mesh reconstruction from TUM RGB-D sequence" /></div>
This project has been implemented during my Master's course in Computer Graphics, Vision and Imaging at UCL. It is basically an implementation of a great paper by Sucar et al., <a href="https://edgarsucar.github.io/iMAP/">iMap</a>, with some minor modifications. <a href="https://vision.in.tum.de/data/datasets/rgbd-dataset">TUM</a> and <a href="https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~ahanda/VaFRIC/iclnuim.html">ICL-NUIM</a> sequences have been used for benchmarking and evaluation of reconstruction quality. The project can be easily run on <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1BKGNl2iTkEsfRbMgC0QSG_QiQ6gZGc7-?usp=sharing">Google Colab</a>.
